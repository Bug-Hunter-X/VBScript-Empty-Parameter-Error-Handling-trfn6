This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to handling empty parameters in functions.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from relying solely on `IsEmpty` and the `Err.Raise` method which can sometimes be inconsistent.
